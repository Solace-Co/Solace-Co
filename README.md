# Solace-Co
Solace is a next level platform for developers to share and sell code on the internet. 

# Tech Stack
## Front-end
For the front-end, Solace will be using React.js to manage all displays for users. 

## Backend
### API
Solace will use an API created in Spring Boot for managing content creation and moderation.

### OAuth
For authentication, Solace will rely on Google's FireBase to manage accounts and log in pools.

### Database
For storing content created by users, Solace will use a MySql database. This is best for a SpringBoot application. 

# Hosting
During beta and testing, Solace will rely on Ntdi's onsite server, then when we are ready for public domain, Solace will migrate to a cloud hosting environment. Whether it be AWS or Oracle Cloud, Solace is up for suggestions on its host.
